As of September 2020, the latest version is Java 15, with Java 11,
a currently supported long-term support (LTS) version, released on
September 25, 2018. Oracle released the last zero-cost public update
for the legacy version Java 8 LTS in January 2019 for commercial use,
although it will otherwise still support Java 8 with public updates
for personal use indefinitely. Other vendors have begun to offer
zero-cost builds of OpenJDK 8 and 11 that are still receiving
security and other upgrades.
